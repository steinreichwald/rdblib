# no import of "tiff_creation" as this would trigger very specific imports
# from pillow ("_tiff_save") which might break installs with older versions
# of pillow. We require a specific version of pillow however I'd like to err
# on the side of caution as most users of rdblib don't need to create tiff
# images from scratch.
